Claps
=====

Claps is a photo sharing application designed to educate people about climate change and improve climate modeling through Collaborative Intelligence. The accompanying online platform will leverage photos and videos from users, along with GPS data, to document real weather occurrences around the world. By collecting this data from multiple users, researchers can study it to improve weather and climate change models, essentially enabling them to 'Predict History'.  With Claps, users will be able to take videos or photos and apply filters, add relevant text, create time-series images of a shift in a natural condition, record the location using geo-tagging, as well as timestamp the photo. The application will compile all user- generated content to generate a collective database using the “Collaborative Intelligence” principle. Based on the images or videos shared by multiple users capturing a specific event, researchers can better predict what will happen next in that area or under similar conditions.
